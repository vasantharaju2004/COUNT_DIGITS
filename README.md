# COUNT_DIGITS
for counting the number of digits in number that are divisible evenly i.e., 
when that number  is divided by one of that digit and leaves remainder 0 , you can addon as count simultaneoulsy.
to prevent  runtime error "lastdigit != 0" as condition.
while running loop the  number N keep reduces on every loop condition, so create a new "temp =N"
so that your N value not change on every loop.
then reduce the number N by dividiing with 10.
